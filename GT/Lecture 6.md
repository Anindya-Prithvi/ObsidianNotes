## Proposition 10
If $G$ is a simple $n$-vertex graph with $\delta(G)\geq (n-1)/2$, then $G$ is connected.  

Proof:
- Choose $u,v\in V(G)$
- It suffices to show that $u,v$ have a common neighbour if they are not adjacent. (since they are connected)
- Since G is simple we have  
   $$|N(u)|\geq\delta(G)\geq(n-1)/2$$  
   

## Proposition 11
Every loopless graph G has a bipartite subgraph with at least e(G)/2 edges.

## Proposition 12
The maximum number of edges in a n-vertex triangle free simple graph is $\floor{n^2/4}$
