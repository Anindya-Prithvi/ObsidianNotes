# Graph Theory
These are the notes for graph theory course. The professor says it'll be a simple course, let's see about that. I am using Obsidian and this is an amazing markdown editor! It has a lot of community plugins. Anyways, study now... xD

## Here is a somewhat detailed overview.
1. [[GT/Lecture 1]] : Introduction to the course and grading. Defining graphs
2. [[GT/Lecture 2]] : Something more here
3. [[GT/Lecture 3]] : Something more
4. [[GT/Lecture 4]] : Cycles and repeated vertices
5. [[GT/Lecture 5]] : A lot of propositions and Eulerian circuit
6. [[GT/Lecture 6]] : It's about to happen (incomp)
7. [[GT/Lecture 7]] : Starting now
8. [[GT/Lecture 8]] : Directed Graphs
