# Lecture one!
So, today was the first class of PB. The course structure is scary enough. For a CSE student, as recommended by the prof., a maximum of 10 hours is required dedicated to this course per week. To give a general overview, the topics are pretty cool, we will be covering genome sequencing and matching (a lot of data science). The recommended language is R, however, python is not a problem. A good databank is *nextstrain*. Visit nextstrain/ncov for data on COVID-19.

## Learning Objectives 
At the end of the course, "I" shall be able to
1. use existing databases to solve Bioinformatics basis of diseases 
2. use available toolkits and R packages for Bioinformatics pipelines 
3. create new methods and tools for Bioinformatics 
4. implement machine learning and artificial intelligence methods for Precision Health Informatics
