**Q1.** Explain why the recursive condition for a sequence to be
graphic (Proposition 14) does not state that the sum of
the sequence is even. (2 marks)

I don't understand the question, however if it means that proposition 14 must be **converted** to the one given in the question, it must be noted that even if the sequence comprises of numbers which sum up to an even number a graph may not exist. E.g. consider sequence $2,2$, if our condition now is just to delete the first vertex and see if the resultant sum is even, we fail right here. A simple graph with one vertex shall not have an edge but per the above statement it is. Hence a contradiction.

**Q2.** PROVE OR DISPROVE: If a sequence $D = \left<d_1, d_2, \dots,d_n\right>$ of non-negative integers with even sum satisfies $d_i < n$ for all $i$, and $|d_i âˆ’ d_j | \leq 1$ for all $i,j$, then $D$ is graphic.

**PROVE**: Consider any sequence, there will always be same number (or the multiple) of vertices as the element in that sequence, otherwise the conditions are violated. In such a case, the subgraphs are complete and the graphic sequence is certain.
