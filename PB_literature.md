1. [Genetic diversity of Sars rdrp alters its ](https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S1045105621000919?token=9C8676EBA32BEE1DA1F3927C9F36A46EA43CEFB7A8AF190EF6D6CE288BAD7FA1EDA96EA1081932FDB06C1551A77B3D64&originRegion=eu-west-1&originCreation=20220327144250)
   - b-cell epitopes: Sites where antibodies bind
   - mutations can alter stability and flexibility of rdrp
   - used coval database-- coval.ccpem.ac.uk (apparently stores all covid seqns)
   - rdrp is mutational [hotspot lol](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-020-02344-6)
   - 44% chance of B cell epitope region mutation. **Could we map the specific places?**
2. [G-Quadruplex structures and PQS](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00251-022-01257-6)
    - G-Quadruplex is hot field
    - Too deep lol
3. Remdesivir and Ledipasivir--potent but in vitro practical
4. Nanotech--biochem
5. [Global SNP analysis](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tbed.13931)
	- Dataset/full genome: GISAID, need cleaning tho
	- performs mutational profiling
	- Single nucleotide polymorphism?
	- nucleocaspid gene -- highest mutational feq
		- followed by Nsp2, Nsp3, Spike
    - Study aim is to give insights for anti-viral therauptics
    - MAFFT (sequence alignment to Wuhan-hu-1 strain MN908947.3) 
	    - Further analysis on QIAGEN and ugene.net
	- Protein structs for RdRp, S and 3CLpro?? obtained from PDB
	- Visualize protein struct using PyMOL
	- Did across the whole globe
6. Plant-derived exosomal microRNAs inhibit lung inflammation induced by exosomes SARS-CoV-2 Nsp12 (full biochem)
7. Marine sponge once again.
8. paid
9. RANAM irrelevant
10. **How about finding prefffered attk site based on stable segment across mutations
	- [Very related](https://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/10.2217/fmb-2020-0120)
11. [Genomic epid chars. in Africa](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0009335)
    - gisaid for data
    - mafft for alignment
    - iqtree for MLE based phylo tree-> iTOL
12. Binding energy based analysis (rdrp)
13. cellentry and keytargets-> fusion membrane fusion->drug repurpose->types, silico repurpose
14. Galidesivir (ebola) -> broad spectrum antibiotic
15. Protein prep and binding sites -> rcsb database -> docking screening, identify structs, enzymes, spikes
