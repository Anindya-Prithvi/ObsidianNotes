# Analysis and design of algorithms
These are the notes for analysis and design of algorithms course. The professor says it'll be an interesting course, let's see about that. I am using Obsidian and this is an amazing markdown editor! It has a lot of community plugins. Anyways, study now... xD

## Here is a somewhat detailed overview.
1. [[ADA/Lecture 1]] : Introduction to the course and grading.
2. [[ADA/Lecture 2]] : Mastering Master Theorem
3. [[ADA/Lecture 3]] : DAC
4. [[ADA/Lecture 4]] : DAC continued
5. [[ADA/Lecture 5]] : Last DAC
6. [[ADA/Lecture 6]] : Dynamic programming 1
7. [[ADA/Lecture 7]] : Knapsack problem
8. [[ADA/Lecture 8]] : Sequence alignment
9. [[ADA/Lecture 9]] : Matrix chains
10. [[ADA/Lecture 10]] : Watashiwa Greed
11. [[ADA/Lecture 11]] : Graph coloring problem (Lecture sched)
12. [[ADA/Lecture 12]] : Greedy 3
13. [[ADA/Lecture 13]]: Graph Algorithms 1 - Undirected DFS
14. [[ADA/Lecture 14]]: Checking 2-Edge connectivity
15. [[ADA/Lecture 15]]: Something
