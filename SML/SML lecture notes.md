# Statistical Machine Learning
These are the notes for Statistical Machine Learning. The first lecture had a slide which detected health of a pig using it's picture. (Future prospects: Hiring/Admissions LOL). Anyways, I am using Obsidian and this is an amazing markdown editor! It has a lot of community plugins. Cool, let's get started!
